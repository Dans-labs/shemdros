// The query Ulrik used in the final version of his COLING article.
// It's a variant of the Richteren 5 query (lq07), and explicitly looks
// for agreement bewteen the verb and the first part of the compound
// subject. It finds 234 instances, over against about 350 instances
// for the same query without the agreement.
